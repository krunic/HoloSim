Tested on the Mac OS X Leopard.

To compile, you will need following libraries installed and compiled on your system:

1. Colada-DOM 2.2 (Needed for Collada loading)
2. CppUnit 1.12.1 (needed for unit testing)
3. xerces-c-3.0.1-x86-macosx-gcc-4.0.tar (Needed for XML parsing)
4. Zlib 1.2.3 (needed for some aspects of ColladaDOM)
5. Doxygen++ (used for automated doc generation, currently uses hardcoded project path)

Later versions might work, but have not been tested.

Furthermore, you would need to change Doxygen file so that it points to the path in your home directory.

Will get to cleaning this build process at some point in the future.
